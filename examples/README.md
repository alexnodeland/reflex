## Quick Comparison

### Basic Example
**Best for**: Learning core concepts

```
Error Events → Threshold Filter → Alert Agent → Notifications
```

Features demonstrated:
- Custom event types with `@EventRegistry.register`
- Trigger registration with `@trigger` decorator
- Composable filters (`type_filter() & source_filter()`)
- Event derivation and publishing

### Support Bot Example
**Best for**: Real-time chat applications

```
WebSocket → Chat Events → LLM Classifier → Response/Escalation
```

Features demonstrated:
- WebSocket integration
- PydanticAI agent with structured output
- Agent tools for context retrieval
- Event chains (message → response → escalation)
- Scoped concurrency per conversation

### Content Moderation Example
**Best for**: High-volume content filtering

```
Content → Rate Limit → Dedupe → LLM Moderator → Actions
```

Features demonstrated:
- Stateful filters (rate limiting, deduplication)
- LLM-powered content classification
- Graduated enforcement (warn → remove → ban)
- Periodic summary triggers for reporting

### Log Anomaly Example
**Best for**: DevOps and observability

```
Service Logs → Dedupe → Error Tracking → Threshold → LLM Root Cause
```

Features demonstrated:
- Multi-service log aggregation
- Source-based filtering
- Threshold-based anomaly detection
- LLM-powered root cause analysis
- Periodic summaries

### Fraud Detection Example
**Best for**: E-commerce and fintech

```
Order → Fraud Agent (scoped per user) → Approve/Hold/Reject
```

Features demonstrated:
- Scoped locking (serialize per user)
- LLM with investigation tools
- Event lineage for audit trails
- Graduated response based on risk score

### Incident Response Example
**Best for**: SRE and operations

```
Alert → Triage → Incident → Escalation → Resolution → Postmortem
```

Features demonstrated:
- Full incident lifecycle management
- AI-powered severity classification
- Escalation chain with multiple levels
- Runbook matching and auto-remediation
- Postmortem automation for high-severity incidents

## Running Examples

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install Reflex with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Start PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d

# Run migrations
alembic upgrade head

# Set API keys (choose based on example)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"  # For most examples
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"     # For basic example
```

### Run Demo Scripts

```bash
# Basic example
python -m examples.basic.main

# Support bot
python -m examples.support_bot.main

# Content moderation
python -m examples.content_moderation.main

# Log anomaly detection
python -m examples.log_anomaly.main

# Fraud detection
python -m examples.fraud_detection.main

# Incident response
python -m examples.incident_response.main
```

### Run Full System

```bash
# Start the API server (loads all examples)
uvicorn reflex.api.app:app --reload

# In another terminal, interact via WebSocket
websocat ws://localhost:8000/ws/user123

# Or send HTTP events
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/events \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type": "chat.message", "source": "ws:user123", ...}'
```

## Creating Your Own Example

1. Create a new directory: `examples/my_example/`
2. Add `__init__.py` and `main.py`
3. Define custom events with `@EventRegistry.register`
4. Create agents (SimpleAgent or BaseAgent with PydanticAI)
5. Register triggers with `@trigger` decorator
6. Add a `README.md` documenting your example

See [docs/extending.md](../docs/extending.md) for detailed guidance.
